# Tasks — 025 Mobile-First Responsive Redesign

- **Functional Specification:** [`./functional-spec.md`](./functional-spec.md)
- **Technical Considerations:** [`./technical-considerations.md`](./technical-considerations.md)
- **Design reference (visual oracle):** [`./design-reference/`](./design-reference/) — `Mobile Audit.html`, `mobile/Mobile Hi-Fi.html`, `desktop/Desktop Hi-Fi.html`

---

## Methodology (binding)

- Each slice leaves the app in a **runnable, working state**. Verify before checking off.
- Slices with testable TypeScript follow the **TDD policy** (RED tests authored failing first, then GREEN implementation, then refactor) — see `savepoint-tanstack/CLAUDE.md` → TDD policy.
- UI changes gate on a **Chrome-MCP (or Playwright-MCP) visual pass in Light + Dark, at phone (~390px) and desktop (~1440px)** against the matching `design-reference/` screen. Authed surfaces may defer the live visual pass when no session is available in the sandbox (IGDB/Twitch OAuth unreachable) — note the deferral, same posture as spec 016/023.
- Component/route tests follow the **elements / actions / given-when-then** shape and assert **user-observable behavior**, not call-envelope shape (`.claude/rules/tanstack/testing.md`).
- Respect FSD boundaries + the C2 DAL rules; mind FOOT-GUNS #1 (`.server.ts` is a client-import boundary), #2 (loader hover-preload), #8 (worker-split). **No new server functions, no new `AppError` subclasses, no DB migration** — presentation-layer only.
- **One responsive boundary: `md` (768px)** for chrome AND filters. New code uses tokens/standard utilities, not arbitrary `[…]` Tailwind values (replace flagged ones as their screens are touched).
- Coverage gate (`src/{entities,features}` ≥85% statements) bites on `filter-library`, `add-game`, `compose-journal-entry` touches — keep them at/above threshold. Most other work is in `widgets/` (ungated) but still tested.
- Commands: `pnpm --filter savepoint-tanstack {dev,typecheck,lint,format:check,test:unit,test:integration,build}`.

## Slice 1 — Foundations: shared `useMediaQuery`, unified `md` boundary, PWA manifest

_Unblocks every later slice; independently testable. Delivers AC GLOBAL-3 (single switch point) and AC X (installability premise)._

- [x] RED: unit test for a shared, SSR-safe `useMediaQuery` (returns a stable value on the server, updates on match-media change). **[Agent: testing]** — RED on missing module; 7 cases (match/no-match/change-both-ways/SSR-safe/useIsDesktop query).
- [x] GREEN: add `src/shared/lib/use-media-query/` (hook + barrel) with a `useIsDesktop()` = `min-width: 768px` convenience; repoint the two existing local copies (`features/command-palette/hooks/use-media-query.ts`, `widgets/game-detail/ui/library-status-switcher/use-media-query.ts`) to the shared hook and delete the duplicates. **[Agent: tanstack-fullstack]** (react-frontend agent broken by a shadcn startup command — reassigned) — 7/7 hook + 66/66 command-palette tests GREEN; both local copies deleted, `rg` confirms no missed importers; a command-palette test mock was repointed too.
- [x] GREEN: normalize the library filter responsive boundary from `xl`→`md` so nav and filters switch together — `features/filter-library/ui/mobile-filter-bar/` (`xl:hidden`→`md:hidden`) and `features/filter-library/ui/library-filters/` (`hidden xl:flex`→`hidden md:flex`). **[Agent: tanstack-fullstack]** — no other `xl:` classes in the feature.
- [x] GREEN: link the orphaned PWA manifest in `src/routes/__root.tsx` `head()` (`<link rel="manifest">` + a `theme-color` meta); correct `public/manifest.json` `theme_color`/`background_color`. **No service worker.** **[Agent: tanstack-fullstack]** — manifest linked + light/dark `theme-color` metas added. **Finding:** the existing `#f6f1e7` is NOT retired cream — it is the exact sRGB of the current light `--background` `oklch(0.96 0.014 85)`, so no manifest color change was needed; dark `#120f0c` added for the dark `theme-color`.
- [x] Gate: unit + typecheck + lint + format green; at ~800px width the library shows desktop chrome AND desktop filters (no broken middle state); browser devtools shows the manifest linked + install eligibility for the manifest. **[Agent: testing]** — typecheck/lint/format/build clean; `test:unit` 178 files / 1591 tests / 0 failures. **Live in-browser visual deferred** (no auth session in sandbox), consistent with methodology.

## Slice 2 — Global action host: open Log / Add from anywhere (URL-driven)

_The one new primitive. Delivers AC GLOBAL-2 / AC FLOW-1 / AC FLOW-4 reachability. Verifiable by URL before any nav button exists._

- [x] RED: component tests — given `action=log-session` in the root search, the host renders the Log flow (Sheet on mobile breakpoint, Dialog on desktop — mock `useMediaQuery`); given `action=add-game`, it renders Add; closing clears the params (router stub); no `action` → renders nothing. **[Agent: testing]** — 10 cases, RED on missing host module.
- [x] GREEN: add the root search-param contract to `src/routes/__root.tsx` `validateSearch` (Zod: `action?: "log-session" | "add-game"`, `game?: string`, both optional). **[Agent: tanstack-fullstack]** — also removed a stale `search={{ page: 1 }}` Link prop in `library-card-menu` that the new root schema rejected.
- [x] GREEN: extract the inner content of the existing flows into reusable content components so page + host share one source of truth — split `features/compose-journal-entry/ui/log-session-drawer/` and `features/add-game/ui/add-game-modal/` into a `*-content` component + a thin host wrapper. Preserve the `.server.ts` boundary (submit server fns imported from non-`.server.ts` files; foot-gun #1/#8). **[Agent: react-frontend]** — `LogSessionContent` + `AddGameContent` extracted and exported from the feature barrels; in-page drawer/modal/FAB unchanged; 1591 existing tests stayed green; `.server` boundary intact.
- [x] GREEN: build `src/widgets/global-action-host/` reading `useSearch({ from: "__root__" })`; render the right flow (mobile `Sheet side="bottom"` / desktop `Dialog`); close → `navigate` clearing `action`/`game`. Mount once in `__root.tsx` beside `CommandPalette` (gated on `user`). **[Agent: tanstack-fullstack]** — mounted; `add-game` fully functional. **DEFERRED:** the `log-session` slug→`{gameId, playthroughs}` data-loading is NOT wired yet (host passes the `game` slug to a content component that currently ignores it). It fails safe (empty `gameId` → ZodError → toast, no corruption) and is unreachable from the UI until Slice 5. **Carry-forward: Slice 5 (dashboard hero, first `&game=slug` trigger) must wire the slug→data lookup so global log-session is functional; Slice 3 owns the no-game picker.**
- [x] Gate: unit + integration (existing compose/add flows still green after extraction) + typecheck/lint green; manually visit `/dashboard?action=log-session` and `/library?action=add-game` → the correct sheet opens and closes; the existing in-page Log (game detail) and Add (library FAB) triggers still work. **[Agent: tanstack-fullstack]** — typecheck/lint/format/build clean; host 10/10; full unit suite green (a `_authed-shell` test was updated to stub the newly-mounted host, mirroring the existing CommandPalette stub). Live in-browser pass deferred (no sandbox session).

## Slice 3 — Bottom nav (5 slots) + topbar + sidebar parity

_Delivers AC GLOBAL-1 / GLOBAL-2 / GLOBAL-4 / GLOBAL-5 / GLOBAL-6 — the keystone navigation fix (NAV-01/02/03/04)._

- [x] RED: tests — bottom nav renders 5 slots (Home→`/dashboard`, Library, center **Log**, Journal, Profile); the Log button navigates with `action=log-session` (router stub); the active tab exposes a filled/accented indicator + `aria-current` (not color-only); icon buttons meet the ≥44px target. Sidebar renders a Home link and a "Log a session" CTA that navigates with `action=log-session`. **[Agent: testing]** — 15 new assertions across the 3 widget suites, RED for the right reasons.
- [x] GREEN: rework `widgets/app-bottom-nav/` to the 5-slot model with a raised center **Log** action (→ `?action=log-session` via `useNavigate` search-updater), `aria-current` active state, ≥44px (`h-11 min-h-11`) on every slot incl. Log. **[Agent: react-frontend]** — verified base className carries the 44px size on all slots, not only active.
- [x] GREEN: `widgets/app-mobile-topbar/` — icon buttons 36→44px (`h-11 w-11`); search is now a button opening the command palette (reuses the sidebar's `openCommandPalette()` path) instead of navigating to `/games/search`. **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] GREEN: `widgets/app-sidebar/` — added a Home/Dashboard link (first nav item) and a prominent "Log a session" CTA under the brand (→ `?action=log-session`); status legend kept. Added a `.pb-safe-nav` utility (`max(1rem, env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`) in `src/styles.css`, applied to the bottom nav + `app-shell` main padding (replaces raw `pb-16`). **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] Gate: unit + typecheck/lint/format green (1615 tests, 0 fail); tapping Log issues the `action=log-session` navigation (opens the Slice-2 host). **[Agent: react-frontend]** **Live Chrome-MCP visual deferred** (authed routes, no sandbox session). **DEFERRED to Slice 3b:** the bottom-nav Log fires `?action=log-session` with NO game → the host has no game picker / slug→data path yet, so the form isn't submittable from this entry point. See Slice 3b.

---

## Slice 3b — Functional global "Log a session" (no-game picker + slug→data)

_Carry-forward from Slices 2 & 3: makes the global Log actually log. Was the Slice-2 deferral + Slice-3's no-game-picker concern, pulled into one coherent increment (the first real Log triggers — bottom-nav Log, then the Slice-5 hero — both need it)._

- [x] RED: tests — given `action=log-session` with no `game`, the host renders a game picker (search / your library); choosing a game sets `game=<slug>` (or loads its data); given `action=log-session&game=<slug>`, the host loads that game's `{ gameId, playthroughs }` and `LogSessionContent` submits against the correct game. **[Agent: testing]**
- [x] GREEN: wire the host's slug→`{ gameId, playthroughs }` lookup via a new feature fn (`getLogSessionGameDataFn` + worker, composing a new `getPlaythroughsBySlug` entity query); `LogSessionForGame` loads + passes real props to `LogSessionContent`; placeholder `game?: string` prop removed. **[Agent: tanstack-fullstack]**
- [x] GREEN: built `LogSessionGamePicker` (lists library via own `getLoggableGamesFn`, FSD-compliant) shown when no `game`; on pick → navigate setting `game` slug; host delegates picker vs `LogSessionForGame`. **[Agent: tanstack-fullstack]**
- [x] Gate: typecheck/lint/build green; host + compose + game-detail + library-item-card suites green. **Integration note:** the new fn wrappers leak the `auth.server` chain into client component tests under vitest — mocked in consuming tests (game-detail, library-item-card), mirroring the `createJournalEntryFn` pattern; prod build strips it. Live in-browser pass deferred (no session). **[Agent: tanstack-fullstack]**

---

## Slice 4 — Library: 2-up shelf + sticky status lens + filters sheet + view toggle

_Delivers AC LIB-1…LIB-6._

- [x] RED: tests — library renders a 2-up cover grid at phone width; a sticky status-lens segmented row (All + statuses with counts) re-filters in one interaction (drives the `status` search param); secondary filters live behind a Filters trigger with an active-count badge; a grid/list toggle switches presentation. **[Agent: testing]**
- [x] GREEN: `widgets/library-page/` — default 2-up grid on phones (`grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5`, tokenized, replacing the arbitrary `[repeat(auto-fill,minmax(…))]` values); grid/list view toggle (local state). **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] GREEN: `features/filter-library/` — `StatusLens` rendered sticky above the grid with per-status counts (passes full filter state so status changes don't clobber other filters); platform/rating/sort stay in the Filters sheet. **[Agent: react-frontend]** — prop types reconciled (`status`/`acquisition` widened to `string` at the lens boundary); exported from the feature barrel.
- [x] Gate: `library-page` + `filter-library` suites 111/111 green; typecheck/lint clean. Live visual deferred (no session). **[Agent: react-frontend]**

---

## Slice 5 — Dashboard: "Jump back in" hero + status strip + swipe rails

_Delivers AC DASH-1…DASH-4._

- [x] RED: tests — dashboard leads with a "Jump back in" card for the most in-progress game whose Log button navigates with `action=log-session&game=<slug>`; status counts render as one compact strip; game rails are horizontal scroll-snap carousels on phone; desktop renders hero + continue rail side by side. **[Agent: testing]**
- [x] GREEN: restructured `widgets/dashboard-page/` mobile-first — new `dashboard-jump-back-in-hero` (Log → `?action=log-session&game=<slug>`, routes through the host — no old dialog), `dashboard-status-strip`, `dashboard-game-rail` (CSS scroll-snap carousel on mobile / `md:grid` on desktop); desktop pairs hero + Playing rail. **[Agent: react-frontend]** — 23/23.
- [x] Verify: hero Log passes the slug through the Slice-3b host (data path already built). **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] Gate: `dashboard-page` suite green; typecheck/lint clean. Live visual deferred (no session). **[Agent: react-frontend]**

---

## Slice 6 — Game detail (mobile): stacked hero, jump spine, sticky action bar

_Delivers AC GD-1…GD-4 (the phone layout; the critical "action never lost" fix)._

- [x] RED: tests — game detail (mobile branch) renders a slim top bar with Back + More and **no breadcrumb**; a stacked hero (cover, critic ring, title on its own line); a sticky jump spine of section anchors; and a **sticky bottom action bar** with a status pill + a working Log trigger. **[Agent: testing]**
- [x] GREEN: `widgets/game-detail/` mobile layout — stacked hero (`pt-[140px]`→`pt-36`, `md:[grid-template-columns:…]`→`md:grid-cols-[200px_1fr]`), translucent Back/More top bar (mobile, via `useIsDesktop`), jump spine + sticky `game-detail-action-bar` (Log → `?action=log-session&game=<slug>`); panels get `id` anchors; desktop unchanged. **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] Gate: `game-detail` suite green; typecheck/lint/format clean. Live visual deferred (no session). **[Agent: react-frontend]**

---

## Slice 7 — Game detail (desktop): two-column + sticky detail rail

_Delivers AC GD-5 — the desktop scale-up of Slice 6._

- [x] RED: tests — game detail (desktop branch) renders a two-column split with a **sticky right rail** carrying the status switcher, a Log CTA, the `CriticScoreRing`, and a "Your time" summary; the jump spine stays sticky beside the content column. **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] GREEN: desktop two-column layout + `game-detail-detail-rail/` sub-component; JS-branch via `useIsDesktop` so the mobile action bar and desktop rail don't both mount. **[Agent: react-frontend]** — "Your time" renders zero-safe (`0h`/`0`, never an em-dash) per the app's no-em-dash rule (integration fix).
- [x] Gate: `game-detail` suite 190/190 green; typecheck/lint clean. Live visual deferred (no session). **[Agent: react-frontend]**

---

## Slice 8 — Journal: compose as a keyboard-aware sheet

_Delivers AC JRN-1…JRN-4._

- [x] RED: tests — the compose flow opens as a bottom `Sheet` at mobile breakpoint and a centered `Dialog` at desktop (mock `useMediaQuery`); the text area is the dominant element; copy states that playtime alone is a complete entry. **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] GREEN: `compose-journal-entry-dialog` branches `Sheet` (mobile, `side="bottom"`, `max-h-[90vh]`) / `Dialog` (desktop) via `useIsDesktop`, optional-thoughts hint inline; existing props/behavior preserved. Desktop `journal-timeline-page` pairs the timeline with a new `journal-stats-rail` (entries / games journaled / "Log tonight"). **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] Gate: compose + journal-timeline-page suites green (71 tests); typecheck/lint clean. Live visual deferred (no session). **[Agent: react-frontend]**

---

## Slice 9 — Profile: compact header + sticky tab strip

_Delivers AC PRO-1 / PRO-2._

- [x] RED: tests — profile renders a compact header (avatar + name + one stat row + a **full-width** primary action) above a sticky tab strip, so content starts high; the primary action is not squeezed into the name row. **[Agent: testing]**
- [x] GREEN: `widgets/profile-overview/` — compact identity block (avatar + name + handle + 4-item inline stat row + full-width mobile primary action), sticky `SegmentedControl` tab strip; arbitrary avatar/banner sizes replaced (`sm:h-[140px]`→`md:h-28`, etc.). **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] Gate: `profile-overview` suite 48/48 green; typecheck/lint clean. Live visual deferred (no session). **[Agent: react-frontend]**

---

## Slice 10 — Settings: mobile grouped list

_Delivers AC SET-1 / SET-2._

- [x] RED: tests — settings renders a grouped list of full-height tappable rows (inline toggles / drill-in) at phone width; rows navigate into the existing `settings/profile` & `settings/account` routes; desktop keeps the two-column layout. **[Agent: testing]**
- [x] GREEN: added `settings-list` (iOS-style grouped rows, 52px min, active state, chevrons); `routes/_authed/settings.tsx` branches via `useIsDesktop` — phone shows the list (or `Outlet` on a sub-route), desktop keeps the `md:grid-cols-[200px_1fr]` rail. No new screens. **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] Gate: settings-list + route suites green (19 tests); typecheck/lint clean. Live visual deferred (no session). **[Agent: react-frontend]**

---

## Slice 11 — Cross-cutting polish + full responsive verification

_Delivers AC X-1…X-4 and the audit's principle-level guarantees._

- [x] Audit + fix: tap targets — game-detail mobile Back/More bumped 36→44px (bottom nav/topbar already 44px from Slice 3); reduced-motion already globally covered in `styles.css` (`prefers-reduced-motion` neutralizes animations); active indicators carry `aria-current`/filled state (not color-only); no stray hardcoded hex (only the intentional platform brand colors); tokens resolve in light + dark. **[Agent: react-frontend]**
- [x] Gate: full suite green — typecheck 0, lint 0, format:check clean, **test:unit 1721**, **test:integration 661** (incl. 3 new integration suites covering the 3b entity query + both workers at 100%), build OK. **Coverage 95.52% statements** after excluding the un-runnable `createServerFn` wrapper bridge layer from the gate (`features/*/api/!(*.worker).ts`) — workers + entity queries stay counted (user-approved gate refinement; the deficit was pre-existing untestable wrappers). **[Agent: testing]**
- [ ] **Deferred (yours to eyeball):** live responsive visual pass across the 8 surfaces at phone + desktop × Light/Dark/System against `design-reference/` — needs an authenticated running app (no session in this sandbox, per methodology). Component tests + the build gate stand in until then.

---

## Notes / Recommendations

| Item | Note |
|---|---|
| Authed visual passes | Live Chrome/Playwright passes on signed-in surfaces (dashboard, library, game detail, journal, profile, settings) may defer where the sandbox has no session (IGDB/Twitch OAuth unreachable), consistent with spec 016/023. Component tests + unauth/landing visual still gate. |
| Sidebar collapse/expand | The desktop sidebar collapse toggle from the design is an **optional enhancement**, intentionally not slotted — add later if wanted. |
| Coverage | Net-new gated code is small (`filter-library`, `add-game`, `compose-journal-entry` touches + `global-action-host` if placed under a gated layer). Keep RED-first to stay ≥85%. |
| No general-purpose agents | Every sub-task maps to a project specialist (`react-frontend`, `tanstack-fullstack`, `testing`); no `general-purpose` fallbacks. |
