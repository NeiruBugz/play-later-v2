# Functional Specification: API Architecture Decision & Implementation

- **Roadmap Item:** API Architecture Decision & Implementation - Evaluate hybrid approach vs. full Route Handlers migration and implement chosen solution
- **Status:** Draft
- **Author:** Product Analyst

## 1. Overview and Rationale (The "Why")

### Problem Statement

The current PlayLater web application uses Next.js Server Actions for backend functionality, which are only accessible to Next.js web applications. This architectural limitation prevents the development of mobile applications, blocking the planned expansion to mobile platforms that would allow users to manage their game collections on-the-go.

### Desired Outcome

Establish a REST API architecture using Next.js Route Handlers that enables mobile application development while maintaining 100% compatibility with the existing web application functionality and user experience.

### Success Criteria

- Mobile applications can be developed using the new API without technical blockers
- Existing web application continues to work identically with no changes to features or user flows
- API provides foundation for future external integrations

## 2. Functional Requirements (The "What")

### 2.1 Architecture Research & Decision

**As a developer**, **I need to** evaluate architecture approaches, **so that** I can choose the optimal solution for long-term maintainability and development efficiency.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Research is conducted on hybrid approach (Route Handlers calling Server Actions) vs. full Route Handlers migration
- [ ] Success stories and case studies from similar Next.js applications are documented
- [ ] Time estimation is completed for both approaches
- [ ] Final architecture decision is made based on maintainability and development time/effort factors
- [ ] Decision rationale is documented for future reference

### 2.2 API Endpoint Implementation

**As a mobile app developer**, **I need to** access all current web application functionality through REST API endpoints, **so that** I can build mobile apps with feature parity.

**Core API Endpoints Required:**

- User authentication and profile management
- Game collection CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete games)
- Game status management (Backlog, Playing, Completed, Wishlist transitions)
- Steam library import functionality
- Review creation, editing, and browsing
- Wishlist management and sharing
- Dashboard analytics data retrieval

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All endpoints return the same data structures currently used by the web application
- [ ] Authentication uses the same Google OAuth flow as the web application
- [ ] JWT token management is implemented for mobile session persistence [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific mobile session persistence mechanisms after mobile development research]
- [ ] HTTP status codes and user-friendly error messages are provided for all error scenarios
- [ ] API responses maintain compatibility with existing web application data consumption

### 2.3 Web Application Compatibility

**As a current web user**, **I need** the web application to continue working exactly as before, **so that** my user experience remains unchanged during the API transition.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All existing web application features work identically after API implementation
- [ ] No user flows or interfaces are modified
- [ ] Web application performance remains at current levels or better
- [ ] No breaking changes are introduced to existing functionality

### 2.4 API Documentation

**As a future mobile developer**, **I need** comprehensive API documentation, **so that** I can efficiently develop mobile applications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] OpenAPI schema is generated and maintained for all endpoints
- [ ] API schema enables automatic type generation for development
- [ ] Basic endpoint specifications document request/response formats

## 3. Scope and Boundaries

### In-Scope

- Research phase: investigating hybrid vs. full Route Handlers approaches
- Architecture decision making and documentation
- Implementation of chosen API architecture approach
- Testing that existing web application functionality remains unchanged
- Creation of OpenAPI schema for external consumption
- Basic API endpoint specifications

### Out-of-Scope

- Mobile application development itself (separate project)
- Advanced API features (webhooks, real-time notifications, etc.)
- API versioning strategy (v1, v2 implementation)
- Third-party developer access management beyond basic API availability
- Comprehensive API documentation beyond OpenAPI schema
- Performance monitoring/analytics for API usage
- Advanced mobile session persistence research [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: To be addressed during mobile development phase]
