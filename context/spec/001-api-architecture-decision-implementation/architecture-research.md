**Project**: PlayLater API Architecture Decision & Implementation
**Date**: September 25, 2025
**Status**: Final Research & Recommendation
**Author**: Technical Architecture Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the existing Next.js 15 PlayLater architecture and extensive research into migration patterns, we recommend proceeding with the **Hybrid Migration Approach** rather than a full Route Handlers migration. This decision is based on current codebase analysis, development time estimates, and alignment with Next.js 15 best practices.

### Key Finding

The existing architecture already demonstrates a mature service layer pattern (`CollectionService`) and successful Route Handler implementation (`/api/collection/route.ts`), making a hybrid approach the optimal path for enabling mobile development while maintaining web application performance.

---

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Patterns

The PlayLater codebase demonstrates several architectural strengths:

**Service Layer Foundation**:

- Established `CollectionService` with proper abstraction
- Repository pattern integration via `buildCollectionFilter()` and `findGamesWithBacklogItemsPaginated()`
- Consistent error handling with `ServiceResult<T>` types
- Comprehensive unit testing framework

**Existing Route Handler Success**:

- `/api/collection/route.ts` successfully implements authentication, validation, service integration
- Clean separation of HTTP concerns from business logic
- Proper error handling and status code management

**Server Actions Coverage**:

- 60+ Server Actions across features for data fetching and mutations
- Consistent patterns with `authorizedActionClient` and schema validation
- Integration with existing repository and service layers

### Architecture Strengths

1. **Repository Pattern**: Established data access abstraction
2. **Service Layer**: Proven business logic abstraction
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Vitest setup with unit/integration test separation
4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage with Zod validation
