# Functional Specification: Service Pattern Implementation

- **Roadmap Item:** Service Pattern Implementation - Introduce service layer architecture for better code organization and testability
- **Status:** Draft
- **Author:** Product Analyst

## 1. Overview and Rationale (The "Why")

### Problem Statement

The current codebase has inconsistent service layer implementation across features. Some areas (like collection and IGDB integration) have well-structured services with proper testing, while others (user, review, steam, dashboard) either have placeholder directories or business logic scattered across server actions, components, and direct repository calls. This inconsistency creates several pain points:

- **Maintenance Difficulty:** When modifying functionality, developers must search across the entire project rather than focusing on a single service
- **Testing Challenges:** Business logic is difficult to unit test when scattered across different architectural layers
- **Development Inefficiency:** Adding new features requires understanding and potentially duplicating logic spread across multiple locations
- **Code Organization:** Lack of a consistent pattern makes the codebase harder to navigate and understand

### Desired Outcome

Establish a unified service layer architecture across all features, following the pattern: **Consumer → Service → Server Action → Repository**. This will centralize business logic in testable services with constructor-based dependency injection for better mocking and isolated testing.

### Success Metrics

- All business logic consolidated into dedicated services
- Improved developer experience when adding or modifying features
- Enhanced testability through isolated service unit tests
- Consistent architectural patterns across the entire codebase

## 2. Functional Requirements (The "What")

### Core Architecture Requirements

- **Service Layer Completion:** All placeholder service directories (user, review, steam, dashboard) must have fully implemented services following the established pattern from collection and IGDB services.

- **Business Logic Consolidation:** All business logic currently scattered across server actions, components, and direct repository calls must be moved to appropriate services.

  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] When a developer needs to modify user-related functionality, all business logic is contained within the UserService
    - [ ] When a developer needs to modify review functionality, all business logic is contained within the ReviewService
    - [ ] When a developer needs to modify steam integration, all business logic is contained within the SteamService
    - [ ] When a developer needs to modify dashboard functionality, all business logic is contained within the DashboardService

- **Architectural Flow Implementation:** Establish the data flow pattern Consumer → Service → Server Action → Repository consistently across all features.

  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] Server actions become thin wrappers that delegate to services
    - [ ] Services contain the core business logic and orchestrate server action calls
    - [ ] Services call server actions which then interact with the repository layer
    - [ ] Route handlers integrate with services using existing patterns without additional complexity

- **Dependency Injection for Testing:** Implement constructor injection pattern for all services to enable better testing.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] Services accept dependencies through constructor parameters
    - [ ] Dependencies can be easily mocked in unit tests
    - [ ] Service unit tests can run without touching external dependencies (database, APIs)
    - [ ] Each service has comprehensive unit test coverage for its business logic

### Implementation Priorities

- **Phase 1:** Complete partially implemented services (game-management) to establish the pattern

  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] Game-management service follows the same structure as collection service
    - [ ] Game-management service has comprehensive unit tests
    - [ ] All game-management business logic is consolidated in the service

- **Phase 2:** Implement missing services incrementally
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] UserService implemented with all user-related business logic
    - [ ] ReviewService implemented with all review-related business logic
    - [ ] SteamService implemented with all Steam integration business logic
    - [ ] DashboardService implemented with all dashboard-related business logic

## 3. Scope and Boundaries

### In-Scope

- Complete implementation of all missing services (user, review, steam, dashboard)
- Finish implementation of partially completed services (game-management)
- Migration of scattered business logic to appropriate services
- Constructor-based dependency injection for testing
- Unit test coverage for all new and updated services
- Consistent architectural flow: Consumer → Service → Server Action → Repository
- Integration with existing Route Handler patterns

### Out-of-Scope

- Database schema modifications or migrations
- Rewriting existing working services (collection, IGDB) unless specifically required
- Adding new features or functionality beyond service pattern implementation
- Performance optimizations beyond what the service pattern naturally provides
- Complex dependency injection containers or frameworks
- Additional typing or response formatting patterns for Route Handler integration
- Major architectural changes to existing working components
