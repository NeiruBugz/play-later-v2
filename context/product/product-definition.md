## 1. The Big Picture (The "Why")

### 1.1. Project Vision & Purpose

To help gamers reduce analysis paralysis and actually play and complete games from their ever-growing libraries, rather than just buying them and leaving them unplayed. With modern storefront sales, Humble Bundles, and subscription services making game libraries enormously large, PlayLater provides a comfortable and organized way to manage gaming backlogs and progress using modern UI/UX and technologies.

### 1.2. Target Audience

Every possible gamer who owns multiple games and struggles with backlog management. This includes casual and hardcore gamers across all demographics who have accumulated large game libraries through sales, bundles, and subscription services, and want to make meaningful progress through their collections.

### 1.3. User Personas

- **Persona 1: "Alex the Overwhelmed Gamer"**
  - **Background:** Works full-time, has limited gaming time (evenings/weekends)
  - **Gaming Habits:** Owns 200+ games from Steam sales, Humble bundles, Game Pass
  - **Goal:** Wants to make the most of limited gaming time by playing and completing meaningful games
  - **Frustration:** Spends 15-20 minutes browsing their library, feels overwhelmed, and either plays the same familiar game again or gives up

### 1.4. Success Metrics

- **Increased game completion rate:** Users complete more games from their backlog per month
- **Community engagement:** Users actively share reviews and create custom lists
- **User satisfaction:** Users feel more organized and less overwhelmed by their game libraries
- **Social interaction:** Growth in review likes, follows, and community-generated content
