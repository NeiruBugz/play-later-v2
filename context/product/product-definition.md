These are thoughtful players across all demographics who have accumulated libraries through various platforms and want to be intentional about their gaming experiences while preserving memories of their journeys through different worlds.

  - **Background:** Works full-time, games intentionally during evenings and weekends

A patient gamer signs up for SavePoint and imports their Steam library for awareness, browses their collection and marks a few games they're curious about exploring soon, starts playing a game and marks it as "Currently Exploring," journals thoughts and feelings during or after play sessions, after finishing or taking a break writes a reflection capturing what the experience meant to them, discovers their next game through similar game suggestions or community collections, reads others' gaming reflections for games they're curious about, creates themed collections to share with the community, and returns periodically to revisit past journal entries and relive cherished gaming memories.
