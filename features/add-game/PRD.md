## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Implementation Approach

#### 4.1.1 Frontend Components

- **AddGameForm**: Main form component with search integration
- **GamePicker**: Search interface with IGDB integration
- **AddToCollectionModal**: Quick-add modal component
- **AddGameFromExternalPage**: External integration component

#### 4.1.2 Backend Services

- **createGameAction**: Type-safe server action for form submission
- **saveGameAndAddToBacklog**: Core business logic for game addition
- IGDB API integration through shared search service
- Repository pattern for data persistence

#### 4.1.3 Data Flow

```
User Input → Form Validation → Server Action → Repository Layer → Database
     ↓
Search API → IGDB Service → Cache → Search Results → UI
```

### 4.2 Data Schema

#### 4.2.1 Input Validation

```typescript
CreateGameActionSchema = {
  igdbId: number(required),
  platform: string(optional),
  backlogStatus: BacklogItemStatus(optional),
  acquisitionType: AcquisitionType(optional),
};
```

#### 4.2.2 Database Entities
