## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Implementation Approach

#### 4.1.1 Theme Management

- **next-themes**: React context provider for theme state management
- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic theme properties throughout the application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes with dark mode variants
- **Local Storage**: Persistent theme preference storage

#### 4.1.2 Component Structure

```typescript
// ThemeToggle Component
const ThemeToggle = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme, systemTheme } = useTheme();

  // Dropdown with theme options
  // Icon animations and transitions
  // Theme switching logic
};
```

#### 4.1.3 CSS Architecture

```css
/* CSS Variables for theme properties */
:root {
  --background: 0 0% 100%;
  --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
  --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
}

/* Smooth transitions */
* {
  transition:
    background-color 0.2s ease,
    color 0.2s ease;
}
```

### 4.2 State Management

#### 4.2.1 Theme State

```typescript
type ThemeState = "light" | "dark" | "system";

interface ThemeContext {
  theme: ThemeState;
  setTheme: (theme: ThemeState) => void;
  resolvedTheme: "light" | "dark";
  systemTheme: "light" | "dark";
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Persistence Strategy

- Browser localStorage for theme preference storage
- SSR-safe hydration to prevent theme flashing
- Automatic system preference detection and monitoring
- Graceful fallbacks for environments without localStorage
