## Questions for Clarification

1. **Scope & Timing**: Should goals be time-bound (monthly/yearly) or open-ended?
2. **Automation Level**: Should progress tracking be manual, automatic, or hybrid?
3. **Social Features**: Do users want to share goals publicly or keep them private?
4. **Goal Types**: What categories of goals should we support (completion, rating, genre-based)?
5. **Notification Preferences**: How should we remind users about their goals?
6. **Integration Depth**: Should goals influence game recommendations or backlog prioritization?
7. **Measurement**: How do users want to track and visualize their progress?
8. **Flexibility**: Should users be able to modify or abandon goals after setting them?

## Suggested User Stories

1. As a completionist gamer, I want to set a goal to finish 12 games this year so that I can stay motivated and track my progress
2. As a genre explorer, I want to set a goal to try 3 different game genres so that I can broaden my gaming horizons
3. As a social gamer, I want to share my goals with friends so that we can encourage each other and compare progress
4. As a busy professional, I want to set realistic monthly gaming goals so that I can enjoy gaming without feeling overwhelmed
5. As a achievement hunter, I want to set Steam achievement-based goals so that I can focus on completing specific challenges

## Integration Considerations

- **Backlog Integration**: Goals should influence backlog item prioritization and recommendations
- **Steam Integration**: Leverage Steam achievements and playtime data for automatic progress tracking
- **Review System**: Goal completion could prompt users to write reviews
- **User Profile**: Goals and progress should be visible in user profiles and statistics
- **Notification System**: Need to send progress updates and deadline reminders

## Edge Cases to Consider

1. **Goal Abandonment**: What happens when users want to give up on a goal mid-progress?
2. **Data Changes**: How do we handle goals when games are removed from platform or Steam library?
3. **Multiple Goals**: What if users set conflicting or overlapping goals?
4. **Progress Disputes**: How do we handle discrepancies between manual and automatic tracking?
5. **Privacy Changes**: What if users change their mind about public vs private goals?
6. **Platform Migration**: How do goals transfer if users change gaming platforms?
