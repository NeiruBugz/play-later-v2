# Incremental Migration Plan - Atomic Commits

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Purpose**: Define atomic, safe migration steps to eliminate boundary violations

## Migration Overview

**Goal**: Eliminate 7 boundary violations through incremental, test-driven migrations  
**Strategy**: Atomic commits with rollback points and comprehensive test validation  
**Safety**: Each commit maintains green build and test suite

## Atomic Commit Sequence

### Phase 1: Foundation (4 commits) - SAFE ‚úÖ

#### Commit 1: Create Service Layer Infrastructure

```bash
git checkout -b feat/service-layer-foundation
```

**Files Created**:

- `shared/services/types.ts` - Core service interfaces
- `shared/services/index.ts` - Service registry
- `shared/services/README.md` - Service usage documentation

**Test Added**:

- `shared/services/service-registry.test.ts` - Basic service instantiation

**Validation**:

- ‚úÖ Build succeeds (no new dependencies)
- ‚úÖ All 313 tests pass
- ‚úÖ No boundary violations introduced

**Rollback**: Delete service files, no impact on existing code

---

#### Commit 2: Move Shared Types (Type-only Migration)

```bash
git checkout -b fix/move-shared-types
```

**Changes**:

- Update imports in:
  - `shared/components/grid-view.tsx`
  - `shared/components/list-view.tsx`
  - Update exports in `shared/types/index.ts`

**Boundary Violations Fixed**: 2 (grid-view, list-view type imports)

**Tests**:

- ‚úÖ All existing grid-view and list-view tests pass
- ‚úÖ No functionality changes

**Validation Command**:

```bash
bun run test shared/components/grid-view.test.tsx shared/components/list-view.test.tsx
bun run build # Should reduce boundary violations by 2

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (Single Commit)

```bash
git revert HEAD
bun run test # Verify rollback success
```

### Multi-Commit Rollback

```bash
git revert HEAD~n # n = number of commits to revert
bun run test # Verify each rollback step
```

### Emergency Rollback (Nuclear Option)

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D [feature-branch]
# Start over from known good state
```

## Validation Checkpoints

### After Each Commit

```bash
# Required validation sequence
bun run test                    # All tests pass
bun run lint                    # Check boundary violations
bun run typecheck               # No TypeScript errors
bun run build                   # Successful build (once violations fixed)

# Performance validation
time bun run test              # Maintain < 8s execution time
```

### Milestone Checkpoints
