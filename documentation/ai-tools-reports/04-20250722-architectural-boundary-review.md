**Date**: 2025-07-22  
**Focus**: Boundary violations analysis and mitigation strategies  
**Branch**: `refactor/introduce-service-layer`

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the current architectural boundaries in the Play Later v2 application, identifies key violations, and provides actionable mitigation strategies. While the application has a solid foundation with the repository pattern, there are significant boundary violations that need addressing to maintain long-term architectural integrity.

## Current Architecture Overview

### Architecture Pattern

- **Pattern**: Repository Pattern with feature-based organization
- **Data Flow**: Next.js App Router ‚Üí Feature Server Actions ‚Üí Repository Layer ‚Üí Prisma ‚Üí PostgreSQL
- **Organization**: Feature-driven directory structure with shared utilities

### Directory Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                    # Next.js App Router pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/              # Feature-specific code (components, server actions, types)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/               # Shared utilities, components, and libraries
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/       # Reusable UI components (shadcn/ui)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/             # Shared utilities and repositories
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ repository/  # Data access layer
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # Shared type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prisma/              # Database schema and migrations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/                # Test setup and utilities
```

## Boundary Violations Analysis

### üî¥ Critical Violations (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 1. Cross-Feature Dependencies

**Impact**: High - Breaks feature isolation and increases coupling

**Specific Violations**:

- **`features/add-game/components/game-picker.tsx`**:

  ```typescript
  import { useIGDBSearch } from "@/features/search";
  ```

- **`features/view-game-details/components/game-quick-actions.tsx`**:

  ```typescript
  import { AddReviewDialog } from "@/features/add-review/components";
  import {
    EditGameEntryModal,
    GameStatusSelector,
  } from "@/features/manage-backlog-item/edit-backlog-item";
  ```

- **`features/manage-integrations/components/service-integration.tsx`**:

  ```typescript
  import { getUserOwnedGames } from "@/features/steam-integration/server-actions/get-user-owned-games";
  import { saveSteamGames } from "@/features/steam-integration/server-actions/save-steam-games";
  ```

- **`features/view-imported-games/server-actions/import-to-application.ts`**:
  ```typescript
  import { saveGameAndAddToBacklog } from "@/features/add-game/server-actions/add-game";
  ```

#### 2. Shared Components with Feature Dependencies

**Impact**: High - Shared components become tightly coupled to specific features

**Specific Violations**:

- **`shared/components/backlog-item-card.tsx`**:

  ```typescript
  import { CompleteActionButton } from "@/features/manage-backlog-item/edit-backlog-item/components/complete-action-button";
  import { MoveToBacklogActionButton } from "@/features/manage-backlog-item/edit-backlog-item/components/move-to-backlog-action-button";
  import { StartPlayingActionButton } from "@/features/manage-backlog-item/edit-backlog-item/components/start-playing-action-button";
  ```

- **`shared/components/grid-view.tsx`**:

  ```typescript
  import { GameWithBacklogItems } from "@/features/view-wishlist/types";
  ```

- **`shared/components/header.tsx`**:
  ```typescript
  import { User } from "@/features/manage-user-info/components/user";
  ```

### üü° Medium Priority Violations

#### 3. API Route Layer Bypass

**Impact**: Medium - Bypasses intended architectural layers

**Specific Violation**:

- **`app/api/steam/disconnect/route.ts`**:
  ```typescript
  import { updateUserSteamData } from "@/shared/lib/repository";
  ```

### üü¢ Low Priority Issues

#### 4. Repository Inter-dependencies

**Impact**: Low - Acceptable but worth monitoring

- **`shared/lib/repository/backlog/backlog-repository.ts`**:
  ```typescript
  import { findOrCreateGameByIgdbId } from "@/shared/lib/repository/game/game-repository";
  ```

## Positive Architectural Aspects

### ‚úÖ Strengths Identified

1. **Clean Repository Layer**: Well-structured data access layer with proper domain separation
2. **Consistent Feature Organization**: All features follow the established structure pattern
3. **No Circular Dependencies**: No circular import patterns detected
4. **Proper Server Component Usage**: App directory correctly uses feature public interfaces
5. **Business Logic Isolation**: No server actions found in shared components

## Mitigation Strategies

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Eliminate Cross-Feature Component Imports

**Strategy**: Move cross-feature components to shared abstractions

```typescript
// Before (Violation)
import { AddReviewDialog } from "@/features/add-review/components";
// After (Fixed)
import { ReviewDialog } from "@/shared/components/dialogs";
```

#### 1.2 Refactor Shared Components

**Strategy**: Use composition patterns instead of direct feature imports

```typescript
// shared/components/generic-game-card.tsx
export function GenericGameCard({
  game,
  actions
}: {
  game: Game;
  actions?: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <div className="game-card">
      <GameInfo game={game} />
      {actions}
    </div>
  );
}

// features/view-collection/components/collection-game-card.tsx
export function CollectionGameCard({ game }: { game: Game }) {
  return (
    <GenericGameCard
      game={game}
      actions={<BacklogItemActions gameId={game.id} />}
    />
  );
}
```

#### 1.3 Create Shared Abstractions

**Strategy**: Extract commonly used functionality to shared layer

```typescript
// shared/hooks/use-igdb-search.ts
export function useIGDBSearch() {
  // Implementation moved from features/search
}

// shared/components/dialogs/review-dialog.tsx
export function ReviewDialog() {
  // Implementation moved from features/add-review
}
```

### Phase 2: Enforcement Mechanisms (Week 3-4)

#### 2.1 Add ESLint Rules

**Strategy**: Prevent future boundary violations through linting

```javascript
// eslint.config.js
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-imports": [
      "error",
      {
        "patterns": [
          {
            "group": ["@/features/*/components/*"],
            "message": "Import components through feature public interface only"
          },
          {
            "group": ["@/features/*/server-actions/*"],
            "message": "Import server actions through feature public interface only"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 2.2 Standardize Feature Public Interfaces

**Strategy**: Create consistent public interfaces for all features

```typescript
// features/add-game/index.ts
// Public interface - what other parts of the app can use
export { AddGameForm } from "./components/add-game-form";
export { useGameCreation } from "./hooks/use-game-creation";
export type { GameCreationParams } from "./types";

// Don't export internal implementation details
// ‚ùå export { InternalGameValidator } from './lib/validator';
```

#### 2.3 Refactor API Routes

**Strategy**: Use feature server actions instead of direct repository access

```typescript
// app/api/steam/disconnect/route.ts
// Before (Violation)

// After (Fixed)
import { disconnectSteamAccount } from "@/features/manage-integrations/server-actions";
import { updateUserSteamData } from "@/shared/lib/repository";

export async function POST() {
  return disconnectSteamAccount();
}
```

### Phase 3: Long-term Improvements (Month 2)

#### 3.1 Implement Dependency Injection

**Strategy**: For complex cross-feature interactions

```typescript
// shared/lib/services/interfaces.ts
export interface GameService {
  createGame(params: GameCreationParams): Promise<Game>;
  findGame(id: string): Promise<Game | null>;
}

// Features implement interfaces instead of importing from each other
```

#### 3.2 Add Architectural Testing

**Strategy**: Automated boundary enforcement

```typescript
// test/architecture/boundary-tests.ts
describe("Architectural Boundaries", () => {
  test("features should not import from other features", () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  test("shared components should not import from features", () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Implementation Roadmap

- Repository inter-dependencies (acceptable pattern)
- App directory imports (following proper patterns)

### Medium Risk

- API route layer bypass (affects consistency)
- Type sharing between features (manageable)

### High Risk

- Cross-feature component dependencies (breaks modularity)
- Shared components with feature dependencies (tight coupling)

## Recommendations Summary

1. **Prioritize cross-feature dependency elimination** - This is the most critical architectural issue
2. **Implement automated boundary enforcement** - Prevent regressions through tooling
3. **Create clear architectural guidelines** - Document patterns and anti-patterns
4. **Regular architectural reviews** - Schedule quarterly boundary assessments

## Conclusion

The Play Later v2 application has a solid architectural foundation but suffers from boundary violations that compromise its modularity and maintainability. The identified violations are fixable through systematic refactoring and the implementation of proper abstractions.

By following the proposed mitigation strategies, the application will achieve:

- **Better feature isolation** and reduced coupling
- **Improved maintainability** through clear boundaries
- **Enhanced testability** through proper separation of concerns
- **Scalable architecture** that can grow with the application

The investment in fixing these boundary violations will pay dividends in reduced technical debt, easier feature development, and improved code quality over the long term.
