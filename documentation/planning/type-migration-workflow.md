# Type Migration Workflow for Complex Refactoring

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the systematic workflow developed during the successful migration from self-written IGDB types to the official `igdb-api-types` package. This process demonstrates how to safely execute large-scale refactoring tasks involving breaking changes across multiple files while maintaining zero downtime and comprehensive test coverage. The approach is optimized for AI-assisted development and can be adapted for similar complex migrations.

## Guiding Principles

- **Safety First**: Comprehensive test coverage before any changes
- **Atomic Changes**: Each phase is independently verifiable and reversible
- **Incremental Progress**: Small, logical steps with clear validation gates
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Maintain functionality throughout the migration
- **Documentation-Driven**: Clear progress tracking and decision recording

## Migration Success Metrics

The IGDB types migration achieved:

- **100% Test Coverage**: All 102 tests passing throughout migration
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: TypeScript compilation successful at every phase
- **8 Atomic Phases**: Each phase independently committable and reversible
- **18+ Files Updated**: All imports working seamlessly after migration
- **Type Safety Improved**: Replaced `any` types with proper type definitions

## The 8-Phase Migration Framework

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Goal**: Establish safety net before making changes

**Actions**:

- Create exhaustive test suite covering all affected functionality
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, database operations)
- Achieve high test coverage on critical paths
- Ensure tests run in isolation and are deterministic

**IGDB Example**:

```typescript
// Created 36 test cases covering:
describe("IGDB API", () => {
  describe("Token Management", () => {
    it("should fetch and cache tokens correctly");
    it("should handle token expiry gracefully");
  });

  describe("Game Data Fetching", () => {
    it("should fetch game by ID with all fields");
    it("should handle API errors appropriately");
  });
});
```

**Validation**: All tests pass before proceeding to next phase.

### Phase 2: Core Entity Migration

**Goal**: Migrate foundational types that other types depend on

**Actions**:

- Identify core entity types (e.g., Platform, Company, Cover)
- Import official types from external package
- Update response types to use official core types
- Fix breaking changes (e.g., optional fields becoming required)

**IGDB Example**:

```typescript
// After (using official type)
import { type Cover } from "igdb-api-types";

// Before
type GameCover = {
  image_id: string; // Required in our custom type
};

// Cover.image_id is optional: string | undefined

// Fix consuming code
const coverImageId = cover.image_id ?? null;
```

**Validation**: TypeScript compiles, tests pass, commit atomically.

### Phase 3: Secondary Type Migration

**Goal**: Migrate types that depend on core entities

**Actions**:

- Import additional entity types (Genre, Screenshot, etc.)
- Remove duplicate custom definitions
- Update type exports for convenience
- Handle compatibility issues

**IGDB Example**:

```typescript
// Remove custom definitions
- type Genre = { id: number; name: string; }

// Import from official package
+ import { type Genre } from "igdb-api-types";

// Re-export for convenience
export { type Genre } from "igdb-api-types";
```

**Validation**: All imports still work, no TypeScript errors.

### Phase 4: Response Type Migration

**Goal**: Update complex response types using migrated entities

**Actions**:

- Update complex response types to use official entity types
- Handle union types (e.g., `number | Company` in official types)
- Keep custom types when official types don't match usage patterns

**IGDB Example**:

```typescript
// Keep custom type for our usage pattern
type InvolvedCompany = {
  company: Company; // Always resolved, not number | Company
  developer: boolean;
  publisher: boolean;
};
```

**Validation**: Response types work with existing API calls.

### Phase 5: Specialized Type Migration

**Goal**: Migrate remaining specialized types

**Actions**:

- Migrate specialized types (Event, Artwork, etc.)
- Handle breaking changes in specialized response formats
- Update specialized response type definitions

**IGDB Example**:

```typescript
// Import official types
import { type Event, type Artwork } from "igdb-api-types";

// Remove custom definitions
- export type Event = { /* custom fields */ };
+ // Event now imported from igdb-api-types
```

**Validation**: Specialized functionality still works correctly.

### Phase 6: Import Validation

**Goal**: Ensure all consuming code works with migrated types

**Actions**:

- Identify all files importing from shared types
- Run comprehensive TypeScript compilation
- Execute full test suite
- Check for runtime compatibility

**IGDB Results**: 18+ files importing from @/shared/types, all working correctly.

**Validation**: No TypeScript errors, all tests pass.

### Phase 7: Cleanup and Optimization

**Goal**: Improve type safety and remove technical debt

**Actions**:

- Replace `any` types with proper typed alternatives
- Consolidate inline type definitions with official types
- Make optional fields truly optional
- Update test fixtures to match new type constraints

**IGDB Example**:

```typescript
// Before
franchise: any;

// After
franchise?: Franchise; // Optional and properly typed
```

**Validation**: Improved type safety without breaking changes.

### Phase 8: Documentation

**Goal**: Document the workflow for future use

**Actions**:

- Create comprehensive workflow documentation
- Document lessons learned and best practices
- Provide examples for similar refactoring tasks
- Record decision rationale for future reference

## Quality Gates & Validation

### Before Each Phase

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Linting passes (or issues addressed)
- [ ] Code runs correctly in development

### Atomic Commit Strategy

Each phase results in a commit that:

- Compiles successfully
- Passes all tests
- Can be easily reverted if needed
- Has clear, descriptive commit message

**Example Commit**:

```
feat(types): migrate core IGDB entity types to igdb-api-types

- Replace custom Platform, Company, GameCover with official types
- Update response types to use Cover instead of GameCover
- Fix type compatibility for Cover.image_id (string | undefined)
- All tests pass and TypeScript compiles successfully

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks & Solutions

1. **Breaking Type Changes**: Wrap official types when they don't match usage
2. **Optional vs Required Fields**: Make previously required fields optional as needed
3. **Union Types**: Create custom types for resolved entities vs ID references
4. **Test Data Compatibility**: Update mock fixtures to match new constraints

### Rollback Procedures

- Each atomic commit can be reverted independently
- Feature flags can isolate changes if needed
- Database migrations are separate from type changes
- External package versions are pinned

## Lessons Learned from IGDB Migration

### Successful Strategies

1. **Test-First Approach**: Prevented all regressions during migration
2. **Incremental Changes**: Enabled safe progress tracking and easy rollback
3. **Type Compatibility**: Custom wrapper types handled usage pattern mismatches
4. **Re-export Strategy**: Maintained clean import paths for consuming code

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Optional Fields**: Official types more permissive â†’ Made fields optional where appropriate
2. **Union Types**: Official used `number | Entity` â†’ Created resolved entity types
3. **Test Fixtures**: New types stricter â†’ Updated mock data to match constraints
4. **Linting Rules**: New types triggered rules â†’ Fixed issues vs bypassing linter
