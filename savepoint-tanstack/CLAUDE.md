# savepoint-tanstack

The SavePoint app — TanStack Start v1. Delivered by spec 021 (migration from Next.js complete); this is the sole, deployed app. It owns Prisma migrations.

## Spec

Spec 021 (the migration that produced this app) lives at [`../context/spec/021-migrate-to-tanstack-start/`](../context/spec/021-migrate-to-tanstack-start/):

- [`functional-spec.md`](../context/spec/021-migrate-to-tanstack-start/functional-spec.md) — the behavior contract.
- [`technical-considerations.md`](../context/spec/021-migrate-to-tanstack-start/technical-considerations.md) — stack, DAL pattern (C2), auth wiring, env, testing.
- [`tasks.md`](../context/spec/021-migrate-to-tanstack-start/tasks.md) — slice-by-slice TDD task list. Methodology header is binding.

## Purpose

The SavePoint backlog-management app on TanStack Start v1: Postgres via Prisma, Better Auth sessions, S3 for avatars/screenshots, IGDB for game data. Runs on `:6060`; deploys via Vercel (Nitro).

## TDD policy

Binding rule from the spec methodology header:

- Every slice lists test sub-tasks **before** implementation sub-tasks.
- Tests are authored failing first (RED), then made to pass (GREEN), then refactored.
- PR descriptions reference the failing-test commit.
- Canary harness sentinel tests live in [`test/canary/`](./test/canary/) and [`test/integration/canary.integration.test.ts`](./test/integration/canary.integration.test.ts) — do not delete them. They prove the unit + integration harnesses are wired.
- The boundary-rule regression guard at [`test/eslint/`](./test/eslint/) is also load-bearing — do not delete.
- During a **RED** sub-task it is fine — and expected — for `typecheck`, `test:unit`, and `test:integration` to fail. Use plain static imports of the not-yet-created module so the failure is clear and TS-honest. Do **not** reach for `import("./x" as string)` / `/* @vite-ignore */` tricks to keep typecheck green; that hides the signal. CI gates at the slice boundary, not at every intermediate commit.

## Component test conventions

Every component / route test in `src/**/*.test.tsx` follows the same shape. See [`src/features/auth-cognito-sign-in/ui/cognito-sign-in-button.test.tsx`](./src/features/auth-cognito-sign-in/ui/cognito-sign-in-button.test.tsx) and [`src/features/auth-email-sign-in/ui/email-sign-in-form.test.tsx`](./src/features/auth-email-sign-in/ui/email-sign-in-form.test.tsx) as the reference shape.

1. **Element vocabulary** — module-level `const elements = { ... }` map of domain-named query helpers wrapping `screen.getByX` / `screen.queryByX`. Names express intent (`getSocialProviderButton`, `getEmailInput`), not RTL mechanics. Centralizes "how do we find X" so a label/role change is a one-place edit.
2. **Action vocabulary** — module-level `const actions = { ... }` map of domain-named user interactions, each composing one or more `elements` calls plus a `userEvent` interaction. Names are domain verbs (`submitForm`, `clickSocialProviderButton`), not mechanical motion. Built on top of `elements` — composition is the point.
3. **Given / When / Then describe nesting** — outer `describe(ComponentName)` for the subject; inner `describe("given …")` for a scenario; `it("...")` is a single Then. The inner describe groups `it`s that share the same arranged state.
4. **Arrange in `beforeEach`, assertion-only `it`s** — `render(...)` and the triggering interaction migrate UP from inside `it` into the sibling `beforeEach`. Each `it` body is **only** the assertion. Multiple `it`s under one `describe` re-run the arrange+act with clean state.
5. **Implicit-setup `userEvent`** — `await userEvent.click(...)` directly. Skip `const user = userEvent.setup()` unless you actually need to configure delay / clipboard / skipHover.
6. **Strings over regex** — `screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Sign in" })`, never `{ name: /sign in/i }`. Strict equality, no regex parsing tax, no case-insensitivity to mask label drift.

A shared page-object-ish helper file is not used yet — `elements` / `actions` are inline per test. Lift to shared helpers only when a real reuse case appears.

## Component file conventions

Every UI component in `src/{app,routes,widgets,features,entities}/**/ui/` lives in its **own folder** with a barrel. The reference shape is [`src/app/error-boundary/`](./src/app/error-boundary/).

Folder layout, where `<name>` is the kebab-case component name:

```
<name>/
├── index.ts              # barrel — public surface
├── <name>.tsx            # component (named export, no default)
├── <name>.type.ts        # prop + view-model types
├── <name>.utility.ts     # pure helpers used only by this component (optional)
└── <name>.test.tsx       # co-located test (optional)
```

**Rules**

1. **One component per folder.** Folder name = component name in kebab-case = file basename. The component itself is a named export matching the PascalCase folder name (`error-boundary/` → `ErrorBoundary`).
2. **`index.ts` is the public surface.** It re-exports the component value and any prop/view-model type that callers outside the folder need:
   ```ts
   export { ErrorBoundary } from "./error-boundary";
   export type { ErrorBoundaryProps } from "./error-boundary.type";
   ```
   Callers import from the folder (`from "./error-boundary"` or `from "@/app/error-boundary"`), never from a sibling `.type` / `.utility` module directly.
3. **Inside the folder, relative `./<name>.type` / `./<name>.utility` is allowed.** That's the whole point — internal cohesion, external opacity. See [`src/app/error-boundary/error-boundary.tsx`](./src/app/error-boundary/error-boundary.tsx).
4. **`.type.ts` holds props plus any view-model types** the component needs to express its shape. Domain types still live in `entities/<noun>/model/`. The `.type.ts` file imports from `model/` when it needs a domain noun — it does not redefine domain types.
5. **`.utility.ts` is for pure, component-local helpers.** Anything reused across components belongs in `shared/lib/` or, if domain-shaped, on the entity. If a `.utility.ts` is reused by a sibling component, lift it.
6. **Parent `ui/index.ts` re-exports each component folder.** Pattern: `export { Foo } from "./foo"; export type { FooProps } from "./foo";` — the extensionless path resolves to the folder's barrel.
7. **No default exports.** Same rule as the rest of the app.

**Migrating from a flat shape:** if you encounter `<name>.tsx` + `<name>.type.ts` as siblings inside `ui/`, move them into a `<name>/` folder and add the barrel. Tests come along unchanged — the relative `./<name>` import resolves to the sibling `.tsx` file inside the new folder.

## FSD layer map

Top → bottom. Lower may not import upper.

| Layer      | Path                               | Holds                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app`      | [`src/app/`](./src/app/)           | Providers, root wiring, global styles, root error boundary                                                                |
| `routes`   | [`src/routes/`](./src/routes/)     | TanStack file-based routes — thin loaders + route components                                                              |
| `widgets`  | [`src/widgets/`](./src/widgets/)   | Composite UI blocks (header, profile overview, library grid)                                                              |
| `features` | [`src/features/`](./src/features/) | User-intent slices. Each has `model/`, `api/` (server fns), `ui/`                                                         |
| `entities` | [`src/entities/`](./src/entities/) | Domain nouns. Each has `model/` (zod + types), `api/` (plain async query fns throwing `AppError`), `ui/` (display-only)   |
| `shared`   | [`src/shared/`](./src/shared/)     | `lib/` (db, logger, errors, auth-client), `ui/` (shadcn primitives), `config/` (env), `api/` (S3, IGDB low-level clients) |

Per-layer guidance is in `src/<layer>/README.md`.

### Import rules

- **Direction:** `app` > `routes` > `widgets` > `features` > `entities` > `shared`. Lower never imports upper.
- **Server fns vs queries:** server fns live in `features/*/api/`; queries in `entities/*/api/`. Feature server fns compose entity queries. Entity queries never import features.
- **No sibling-to-sibling imports** inside `features/` or `entities/`. Cross-feature reuse goes through `shared/` or an `entity`.
- **Routes are thin:** loaders call entity queries directly (server-side); route components render widgets. No business logic in routes.
- Enforced by `eslint-plugin-boundaries` in [`eslint.config.mjs`](./eslint.config.mjs). Regression-guarded by [`test/eslint/`](./test/eslint/).

## DAL conventions (C2 pattern)

Two layers only — no service classes, no `Result` wrappers, no domain mappers. Vocabulary used below ("loader-direct read," "feature server fn," "UX-hint query," "privacy invariant," "handler helper") is defined in [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md). Read that first.

### File naming: `.server.ts` is a bundler boundary, not a runtime tag

The `.server` suffix is enforced by TanStack Start's `import-protection` Vite plugin: any file matching `**/*.server.*` is **forbidden** to be imported from a client module. The bundler refuses to ship it.

- Use `*.server.ts` ONLY for genuinely server-only modules: DB clients, the Better Auth instance, `getServerUserId`, entity queries (read directly from Prisma; throw `AppError`s).
- **Do NOT use `*.server.ts` for `createServerFn`-wrapped modules.** These files ARE meant to be client-importable — the plugin replaces the handler body with an RPC stub on the client build. Tagging them `.server.ts` defeats the construct and crashes the dev server with `[import-protection] Import denied in client environment`.

Mental shortcut: "anything that runs on the server gets `.server.ts`" is wrong. `createServerFn` runs on the server but is **called from the client** through the bridge — its file must be client-importable.

1. **`entities/<noun>/api/*.server.ts`** — plain async server-only queries. Direct Prisma calls via the [`prisma`](./src/shared/lib/db.ts) singleton. Throw [`AppError`](./src/shared/lib/errors.ts) subclasses (`NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`, `ValidationError`, `UnauthorizedError`, `UpstreamError`) on failure. No DI, no classes. **Reference:** [`src/entities/profile/api/get-profile.server.ts`](./src/entities/profile/api/get-profile.server.ts).
2. **`features/<intent>/api/<name>.ts`** (NO `.server` suffix) — `createServerFn` wrappers from `@tanstack/react-start`: `.inputValidator(...).handler(async ({ data }) => …)`. Delegate to entity queries. Resolve `userId` via `requireUserId()` (handler helper) — never trust it from input, never call `getServerUserId` directly. **Reference:** [`src/features/auth-email-sign-in/api/get-email-sign-in-enabled.ts`](./src/features/auth-email-sign-in/api/get-email-sign-in-enabled.ts).

Errors bubble up to the route `errorComponent` or the root error boundary at [`src/app/error-boundary/`](./src/app/error-boundary/) (mounted in `__root.tsx`), which branches on `AppError.code` for user-facing copy.

### Binding rules

- **Strict feature-server-fn rule.** A `features/<name>/api/` server fn exists **iff at least one consumer is not a route loader**. Non-loader consumers: client components (`useServerFn`), other server fns, route `beforeLoad` guards. If only a route loader needs it, write a [loader-direct read](./CONTEXT.md#loader-direct-read) — no escape hatch for "the composition is large." **Bundler caveat (TanStack Start v1):** the canonical loader-direct shape (top-level `import { x } from "./x.server"` in a route file) hangs the app on hover-preload because Vite's `import-protection` denies those imports in the client bundle and TanStack's route extractor doesn't strip them. Until the extractor learns this, route loaders that need server-only modules must wrap the work in a `createServerFn` exported from a non-`.server.ts` file (mirroring `getProfileSettingsFn`); these loader-only server fns are tolerated despite the strict rule. Full discussion in [CONTEXT.md → Loader-direct read → Known bundler caveat](./CONTEXT.md#loader-direct-read).
- **Authed handlers use `requireUserId()`.** The handler helper resolves the request internally and throws `UnauthorizedError` on miss. The route-guard `requireUserIdOrRedirectFn` is for `beforeLoad` (it redirects). The low-level `getServerUserId(request)` is for tests and conditional-read paths only.
- **Validate twice.** `.inputValidator` runs only on cross-network calls; programmatic callers (other server fns, tests, route loaders calling another server fn) bypass it. The handler must re-`parse` with the same schema. The redundancy is structural, not duplicative — it covers two distinct call paths. Handlers must not branch on whether they're under test or wrap `getRequest()` with a try/catch fallback.
- **Single source for database invariants.** Each unique/FK constraint is translated to `AppError` in **exactly one place**: the entity update query that maps the Prisma error code (inspect `error.meta?.target` to scope the mapping to the right column). Feature handlers do not pre-check.
- **UX-hint queries are not enforcement.** Queries like `getUsernameAvailability` exist only for live UI feedback. They are never called from a feature handler as a precondition check. See [UX-hint query](./CONTEXT.md#ux-hint-query).
- **Privacy invariants live on the entity.** A privacy gate (e.g., "public profile only") is encoded inside the entity query that throws `NotFoundError` for both "missing" and "denied," not in a feature handler or route guard. See [Privacy invariant](./CONTEXT.md#privacy-invariant).
- **No specialized subset queries.** If query `B`'s result is a field of aggregate `A`'s result, delete `B` and read from `A`. Change `A`'s shape if it's wrong.

**ID format:** Better Auth emits 32-char nanoid user IDs. Never use `z.string().cuid()`; use `z.string().min(1)`.

**FSD reaffirmation for the DAL:** entity queries import only from `@/shared/*`. Feature server fns import from `@/entities/*` and `@/shared/*`. Server fns never import other features; entity queries never import features. Enforced by `eslint-plugin-boundaries`.

### Pending compliance (refactor in flight)

Code that does not yet match the rules above — to be cleaned up in the next architectural commits. Listed so the rules read as the source of truth, not the code:

- `getCurrentUserIdFn` in `entities/session/api/get-current-user-id.ts` is the "redirect-if-authed" gate used by `/login` to bounce signed-in users to `/profile`. Its name reads as a low-level reader, not a guard — to be renamed (e.g., `redirectIfAuthedFn`) in a follow-up so the two redirect intents are symmetrically named with `requireUserIdOrRedirectFn`.

## Path aliases

From [`tsconfig.json`](./tsconfig.json):

- `@/*` → `src/*` (preferred)
- `#/*` → `src/*` (alternative — also wired in `package.json` `imports`; both resolve identically; may be consolidated later)
- `@env` → root [`env.ts`](./env.ts) (typed env from `@t3-oss/env-core`). **Never read `process.env.*` outside `env.ts`.**

## Foot-guns reference

Silent-failure runtime traps surfaced during the migration — bundler-graph traps, the env-boundary trap, runtime/dev-environment traps, and the test-infrastructure trap — are catalogued in [`FOOT-GUNS.md`](./FOOT-GUNS.md). Read that file **before** adding server fns, browser-direct AWS calls, or touching `env.ts` / singleton constructors. The supply-chain incident response playbook (CVE-2026-45321 and its successors) lives there too.

## Divergence log

The slice-by-slice migration record — "what the spec-021 port did differently from the prior Next.js app and why," including the Logger (S7) port note, the Vertical-1 verification matrix, and every "Intentional divergences (Slice N)" / "Known gaps (Slice 14A)" entry — is in [`DIVERGENCES.md`](./DIVERGENCES.md). It is a historical log; append new entries only if a future change references a documented divergence.

## Per-layer rules

Binding agent rules for each FSD layer plus three cross-cutting concerns (server fns, testing, errors) live at [`../.claude/rules/tanstack/`](../.claude/rules/tanstack/README.md) (repo-root, with subdirectories per sub-project). Each rule file carries a `paths:` frontmatter entry, so Claude Code **auto-loads** the relevant file when reading files matching the glob — e.g. `widgets.md` loads when Claude reads anything under `src/widgets/`.

The rule files are prescriptive — they pin the conventions documented in this file and in `src/<layer>/README.md` to enforceable, scoped rules. See [`INDEX.md`](../.claude/rules/tanstack/README.md) for the full map and the [Claude Code memory docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#path-specific-rules) for how path-scoped auto-loading works.
