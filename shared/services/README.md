# Service Layer for Boundary Violation Elimination

This service layer provides abstractions to eliminate architectural boundary violations between features. It implements the service layer pattern with dependency injection to decouple features and maintain clean architecture.

## Overview

We're using two complementary approaches to eliminate 7 boundary violations:

### **Business Logic Services** (This Directory)

2. `view-imported-games` → `add-game` (server actions)
3. `manage-integrations` → `steam-integration` (server actions)

### **Component Recomposition** (Separate Strategy)

1. `view-game-details` → `add-game` (modal components) → **Move modals to shared/components**
2. `view-game-details` → `manage-backlog-item` (modal components) → **Move modals to shared/components**
3. `view-game-details` → `add-review` (modal components) → **Move modals to shared/components**
4. `view-game-details` → `steam-integration` (achievement component) → **Move to shared/components**
5. `shared/components` → various features (type definitions) → **Move types to shared/types**

## Architecture

### **Real Business Services** (This Directory)

1. **Game Management Service** - Consolidates game creation and backlog operations
2. **Steam Integration Adapter** - Abstracts Steam platform operations

### Migration Strategy

The service layer is implemented in phases:

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure (CURRENT)

- ✅ Service interfaces defined in `types.ts`
- ✅ Service registry created in `service-registry.ts`
- ✅ Stub implementations that throw errors
- ✅ No boundary violations introduced

#### Phase 2: Type Migration

- Move shared types from features to `shared/types`
- Update imports in shared components
- Fix 2 boundary violations (grid-view, list-view)

#### Phase 3: Component Services

- Implement modal service with lazy loading
- Update view-game-details components
- Implement navigation service
- Fix 3 more boundary violations

#### Phase 4: Business Logic Services

- Implement game management service
- Implement Steam integration adapter
- Migrate remaining components
- Fix final 2 boundary violations

## Usage

### Service Registry

```typescript
import { createBoundaryViolationServices } from "@/shared/services/service-registry";

// Create service instance
const services = createBoundaryViolationServices();

// Use services (once implemented)
const result = await services.gameManagement.createGameAndAddToBacklog(
  input,
  userId
);
```

### Component Integration

```typescript
// Phase 3+ usage in components
export function GameQuickActions({ game, backlogItems }) {
  const services = createBoundaryViolationServices();

  return (
    <div>
      <services.modals.AddToCollectionModal
        gameTitle={game.name}
        igdbId={game.igdbId}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Server Action Integration

```typescript
// Phase 4+ usage in server actions
export const importToApplication = authorizedActionClient
  .inputSchema(ImportToApplicationSchema)
  .action(async ({ parsedInput, ctx: { userId } }) => {
    const services = createBoundaryViolationServices();

    return await services.gameManagement.importSteamGameToCollection(
      parsedInput.steamAppId,
      userId
    );
  });
```

## Testing

### Service Layer Tests

Service implementations include comprehensive unit tests:

```typescript
// Example: shared/services/service-registry.test.ts
describe("BoundaryViolationServiceRegistry", () => {
  it("should create all required services", () => {
    const services = createBoundaryViolationServices();

    expect(services.gameManagement).toBeDefined();
    expect(services.steamIntegration).toBeDefined();
    expect(services.modals).toBeDefined();
    expect(services.navigation).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

Each phase includes validation that existing functionality remains unchanged:

1. All 313+ tests must pass
2. Build must succeed with reduced boundary violations
3. Performance must remain under 8 seconds
4. No functionality regressions

## Implementation Status

### Current Phase: 1 (Infrastructure) ✅

- [x] Service interfaces defined
- [x] Service registry implementation
- [x] Stub service implementations
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Foundation tests ready

### Next Phase: 2 (Type Migration)

- [ ] Move `features/view-wishlist/types` → `shared/types/wishlist.ts`
- [ ] Update grid-view.tsx imports
- [ ] Update list-view.tsx imports
- [ ] Verify 2 boundary violations eliminated

## Safety Measures

### Rollback Strategy

Each phase is atomic and can be rolled back:

```bash
# Rollback current phase
git revert HEAD

# Verify rollback success
bun run test
bun run lint
```

### Validation Checkpoints

After each commit:

```bash
# Required validation sequence
bun run test                    # All tests pass
bun run lint                    # Check boundary violations
bun run typecheck               # No TypeScript errors
bun run build                   # Successful build
```

## Future Enhancements

The service layer architecture enables:

1. **Platform Extensibility** - Easy addition of new gaming platforms
2. **Service Composition** - Combining services for complex workflows
3. **Testing Isolation** - Mock services for unit testing
4. **Feature Flags** - Gradual rollout of new implementations
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Service-level metrics and tracing

## Maintenance

### Adding New Services

1. Define interface in `types.ts`
2. Add to `BoundaryViolationServiceRegistry`
3. Implement service class
4. Update `createBoundaryViolationServices()` factory
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

### Service Dependencies

Services follow dependency injection patterns:

- Services depend on repositories, not other services
- UI services use lazy loading for performance
- Business logic services are stateless
- All external dependencies are injected via constructor

This approach maintains loose coupling and high testability throughout the service layer.
