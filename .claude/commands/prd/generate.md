# Phase 4: Generate Final PRD for $ARGUMENTS

I'll now synthesize all validated outputs from the previous phases into a comprehensive Product Requirements Document.

## Workflow Completion Status

Let me verify all phases are completed:

@documentation/prds/.$ARGUMENTS-state.json

## Final PRD Generation

Using all validated inputs from phases 1-3, I'll generate the complete PRD document:

### Phase Inputs

1. **Requirements Discovery** - Validated user stories, scope, and acceptance criteria
2. **Problem Analysis** - Confirmed problem statement, user personas, and success metrics
3. **Solution Design** - Approved technical architecture and implementation plan

### PRD Template Integration

I'll use our collaborative PRD template designed for AI-human workflow:

@documentation/templates/ai-collaborative-prd-template.md

### Document Assembly

The AI will populate all template sections with:

- **Executive Summary** - Concise overview of feature, problem, and solution
- **Problem Definition** - Validated problem statement and user research
- **Solution Design** - Approved technical approach and architecture
- **Requirements** - Complete functional and non-functional requirements
- **Implementation Plan** - Technical specifications and development timeline
- **Risk Assessment** - Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- **Success Metrics** - Tracking plan and success criteria

## Generated PRD Document

The final PRD will include:

### Metadata & Tracking

- Document version and approval workflow
- AI-human collaboration audit trail
- Stakeholder sign-off sections

### Business Context

- Problem statement with user research backing
- Success metrics and measurement plan
- Competitive analysis and market context

### Technical Specifications

- Complete architecture design
- Database schema changes
- API specifications and integration points
- UI/UX flow and component design

### Implementation Details

- Development timeline and milestones
- Resource requirements and dependencies
- Testing strategy and quality gates
- Deployment and rollout plan

### Risk Management

- Technical and business risk assessment
- Mitigation strategies and contingency plans
- Rollback procedures and success criteria

## PRD File Creation

The complete PRD will be saved as:

```
documentation/prds/$ARGUMENTS-prd.md
```

This becomes the authoritative document for:

- **Stakeholder approval** and sign-offs
- **Development team** implementation guide
- **Project management** timeline and milestones
- **Quality assurance** testing requirements

## Final Human Review

After generation, you should:

1. **Review completeness** - Are all sections thoroughly populated?
2. **Validate accuracy** - Does everything reflect your validated inputs?
3. **Check consistency** - Are there any contradictions between sections?
4. **Stakeholder alignment** - Is this ready for approval workflow?
5. **Technical accuracy** - Do specs match approved solution design?

## Approval Workflow

With the complete PRD:

1. **Product Owner** review and approval
2. **Technical Lead** architecture validation
3. **Engineering Manager** resource and timeline approval
4. **Stakeholder** final sign-offs
5. **Development kickoff** - Ready for implementation!

## Workflow Completion

This marks the end of the AI-assisted PRD creation process. The comprehensive document includes:

- ✅ All AI analysis with human validation
- ✅ Complete technical specifications
- ✅ Implementation roadmap
- ✅ Success metrics and tracking
- ✅ Risk assessment and mitigation

**Generating Final PRD Document** - This will create a comprehensive, ready-for-approval PRD from all your validated inputs across the 4-phase workflow!
